Before using the code in this project, what you need to do is to log in to the https://console.developers.google.com/ link and get an api key.
Here is a example video shows you how to take API key:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jykW3AX8pEE&ab_channel=TheLapLife


- enter the API Key you get and the channel name you want to the gui you will see after starting the program
- enter frequency of the data you want to see (what is the time between two datas you want to get)
-- you can choose between getting data one time or more than one time too
- after that you need to set a database name for your data
- it will create a database with the name you give and inside that you will see a table with the information you wanted with that days date.
- you can get up to 50 videos at most.
- if you enter a wrong API key or channel name you will get an error message.
